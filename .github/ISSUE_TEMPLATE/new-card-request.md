**Additional context**
Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.

**Community Pitch**
Explain why your request would benefit the whole community. I am happy to take suggestions, but I only want to add cards that could be useful to the entire community.  If you need custom cards for a your own server's needs, the card template is included in /dev/card.bbmodel and the nameplate texture template is included in /dev/Card Text.psd
