# Trading Cards Resource Pack<br /><br />
Resource Pack for Minecraft Spigot TradingCards Plugin.<br /><br />

#### *[Currently there is a bug in OptiFine 1.19.3 Pre-release that prevents loading of entity textures. This causes a black and purple checkerboard texture to appear on cards. This issue has been reported and should be resolved by the time OptiFine 1.19.3 has an official release.]*
